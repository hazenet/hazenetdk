# Jekyll Source Code for Hazenet.dk

The Jekyll setup I am using is primarily based on [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com){:target="_blank"}, although I have modified a bit.
I have modified the navigation bar, to be placed between two lines and I have also split the navigation bar in two, floating left and right.

I have added pagination with inspiration from the [Lanyon Theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) of the [Poole Jekyll setup](http://getpoole.com).

I have added Tags and a Archive page, with great inspiration from [Scott S. Lowe's blog](http://blog.scottlowe.org). In general I have look a lot at Scott's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/lowescott/lowescott.github.io), to see how to do things in Jekyll.

I am using the [Jekyll-Lunr-JS-Search](https://github.com/slashdotdash/jekyll-lunr-js-search) project for my search page.

For "Continue reading" links, I am using this [spilt filter technique](http://mikeygee.com/blog/truncate.html) by Michael "Mikey" Gee.

I am also using a [Image.html](http://codingtips.kanishkkunal.in/image-caption-jekyll/) file in my _includes folder, for centering images in my blogpost and also added a small shadow to them.
