I am very pleased to announce that [Rasmus Haslund](http://www.perfectcloud.org){:target="_blank"}, instructor and consultant at Arrow ECS, and my self have started a Veeam User Group in Denmark.

Our plan is to hold 2, maybe 3, meetings per year. And we will try to "model" this User Group after the very proven and good concept from VMware's User Group (VMUG)<!--break-->.

## First meeting

The first meeting will be held on Friday the 13. of march 2015, at Arrow ECS' premises, Baltorpvej 158, 2750 Ballerup, Denmark, from 12.30 to 15.30.

The agenda and booking of tickets can be found here:

We are very lucky and honored to have Rick Vanover, Product Strategy Specialist and Community Manager at Veeam Software in United States, come to our first meeting and also to be presenting during the day.

## Contact info to Veeam User Group Denmark

We have set up a LinkedIn group:
[Veeam User Group Denmark, on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=6927575){:target="_blank"}

We also set up a Twitter Account:
