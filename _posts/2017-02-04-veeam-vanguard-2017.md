## What is the Veeam Vanguard program
**The short version:**  
Veeam Vanguard is THE BEST community influencer program I know of.

**Slightly longer version:**  
The Veeam Vanguard program is a community influencer program, along the lines of VMware vExpert, Cisco Champions and EMC Elect.
Compared to the other programs, Veeam Vanguard is kept small, but on purpose.  
The program leader of the Veeam Vanguard program, Rick Vanover once said that if he could not remember all the Vanguards names, the program would be too big.

The Vanguards are selected on their activities in and for the community for the past year.  
So you fill out an application with  information about what you have done in the past year around the Veeam community. Like blogposts, seminars, user groups, presentations and other activities.

When selected to be part of the Vanguards, you of cause gain some benefits. They be like:

* Access to the Veeam Vanguard Slack messaging platform. Where other Vanguards and Veeam employees are very active
* Access to private Veeam Vanguard forum area on the Veeam Communities Forums, with special beta access and access to "insider" knowledge of what is happing in regards to Veeam products
* Annual Veeam Vanguard meet-up, with presentations and knowledge-sharing from Veeam product managers and Veeam management. The meet-up, travel and accommodation is paid for by Veeam
* Good opportunities to collaborate with Veeam on expanding the community presence, by writing blogposts, creating whitepapers,  create webinars or submit sessions for Veeam's own conference VeeamON
