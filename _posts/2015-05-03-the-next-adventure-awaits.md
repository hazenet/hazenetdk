Last Thursday, was my last day at Businessmann A/S.  
When I started at Businessmann A/S on September 1st 2013 as a Consultant, I was rather inexperienced in the World of Virtualization.  

Since then I have passed several certifications, met a lot of people and experienced even more<!--break-->.

In the 20 months I was employed a Businessmann A/S, my job title changed from Consultant to Senior Consultant. I attended a VMware vSphere Fast Track course and a Veeam Certified Engineer course. I never missed a VMUG meeting in Denmark during my time a Businessmann A/S, which have introduced me to a lot of friends and good people. I have given 3 presentations at different VMUG meetings in Denmark. Most likely because of these presentations I have earned the recognition as vExpert in both 2014 and 2015. Besides vExpert, I have also received the recognition as Veeam Technical Expert and PernixData PernixPro. On top of all that I have had the opportunity to attend VMworld Europe in both 2013 and 2014, where I was fortunate enough to make several international connections to some of other passionate people in the vCommunity.

The team I am joining consists of Senior Cloud Architect Nicolai Sandager and Senior Cloud Architect Heino Skov, with my boss being Business Unit Manager Ole V&aelig;hrens.
