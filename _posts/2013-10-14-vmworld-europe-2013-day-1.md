I arrived in Barcelona sunday night with my colleagues, [Heino Skov](http://www.heinoskov.dk){:target="_blank"} and Brian Markussen, and couple of customers<!--break-->.

Sunday night, we had a few beers, which where payed by the nice people from Avnet.

Many of the danish VMworld attendees where there, and we had some good talks.

This morning we got registered at the conference center, and got our badges and bags.

During the day, I have talked with a lot of people in the VMware community.

Also been by the Hands-On-Labs, and took two labs, vSphere Distributed Switch from A to Z (HOL-SDC-1302) and Virtual Storage Solutions (HOL-SDC-1308).

Later I will attend the Parter General Session, and then go out to the [Businessmann](http://www.businessmann.dk){:target="_blank"} arranged dinner, with the colleagues and customers.

I am very much looking forward to the coming days and sessions.
