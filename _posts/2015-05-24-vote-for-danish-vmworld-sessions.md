## Session 5132
**Title:** Learn About Two Customer Use Cases on Extending VRealize Automation with vRealize Orchestrator Using Advanced Service Designer and Day 2 Actions  

**Track (subtract):** Software-Defined Data Center (Cloud Management)  

**Abstract:**  
Requesting a blueprint in vRealize Automation (vRA) is a quite simple use case. In the first use case we will do a walkthrough on how to use Advanced Service Designer (ASD) and vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) to request information from multiple users (a user and an administrator) before deploying the blueprint. In the second use case we will do a walkthrough on a blueprint action, a day2 operation, that will migrate a virtual machine from a staging environment to the production environment, including changing guest IP addresses, and joining the machine to the target domain using in-guest scripts through VMware Tools.
