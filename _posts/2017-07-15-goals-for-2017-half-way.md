So we have now passed the half way mark of the year, so I thought at a follow up on my blogpost about my [Goals for 2017]({% post_url 2016-12-31-goals-for-2017 %}) would be in order.

* **Energy efficient Homelab**  
So this is almost complete.
I have now relocated the Homelab setup from my home office to the wash/storage room of the house.
I have gotten the 22U rack cabinet in place, and purchased a Intel NUC (NUC7i3BNH).  
I have also "upgraded" my networking kit, which previously was a mix of UBNT UniFi and EdgeMax units, to now be completly UBNT UniFi based.  
All that is missing is the setup of VMs. My plan is to make this mostly a coding Homelab, with vRealize Orchestrator as the center<!--break-->.

* **More blogposts**  
I have currently written 7 blogpost including this one, so that is on track.  
Hopefully I will be able to write even more posts in the last half of the year, now that I have a working Homelab again. 

* **VMUG presentation**  
No VMUG presentation yet, but there is still one VMUG meeting scheduled in Denmark, so it is still possible to achieve this goal.

* **Code sharing**  
Unfortunately most of my work have been for a single customer this year, which have very strict policies about ownership of the code written. So I have not shared much.  
I have been pushing internally in Proact for a more openminded approach to code and community sharing.

* **International conference**  
Although I have been offered to go both to VeeamON in New Orleans and VMworld in Las Vegas, I have had to decline because of the baby boy and the family situation here at home. 

* **User Groups**  
Regarding User Groups, it seems to be going okay.  

	* **Veeam User Group Denmark (VeeamUGDK)**  
We have already had one meeting, where I unfortunately was unable to attend my self.
And we have a second meeting planed for Friday 13th of October 2017.

	* **VMware Automation User Group Denmark (VMAUGDK)**  
One meeting as been held, which was the original goal.
The meeting as a Special Interest Group (SIG) at a larger VMUG meeting in Denmark on Thursday 30th of March at a large cinema in Copenhagen, where VMUG Denmark had arranged for 3 cinema auditoriums.

* **Podcast**  
I had a few talks with different podcast organisers about 2 months ago, but it "died" down again, so still no plans for a podcast. I will have to pursue this again.

* **Blog sponsors**  
So this is "half-way" done. I have rewritten the CSS part of the website, to accommodate the Sponsor graphics.
I have sponsor graphic from Veeam, but I actually don't have a signed deal yet. I need to follow up on this, and get that closed. And try to find a second sponsors as well.

* **vRealize Orchestrator Book Project**  
I have started a bit on this book project agian, [vRealize Orchestrator - the community book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/hazenet/vrealize-orchestrator/details){:target="_blank"}. But it is har dto find the time to write, and I have also been missing the Homelab to test stuff in.

* **vExpert and Veeam Vanguard**  
I have been selected as both VMware vExpert and Veeam Vanguard for 2017, so that is done.
And I am trying to be invovled in the 2 communities, so hopefully I will acheive VMware vExpert and Veeam Vanguard status again next year.

* **Certifications**  
The goal was the below certifications, but because of both work and family I have not yet had time to take any of these.

	* At lest one of the VMware VCAP-CMA
	* Veeam Certified Architect

* **Book reading list**  
Unfortunately I have not had the time to read any of the books on my reading list yet, but I am hoping to get some reading done in the second half of the year.

	* [VMware vRealize Orchestrator Cookbook - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/vmware-vrealize-orchestrator-cookbook-second-edition){:target="_blank"}  
	* [Mastering vRealize Automation 7.1](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-vRealize-Automation-7-1-Implementing/dp/1539470962){:target="_blank"}

So that is the current status for the first half of the year. I will do a final follow up, when we enter the new year.
