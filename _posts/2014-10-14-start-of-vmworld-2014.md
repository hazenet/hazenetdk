So back at VMworld, even through it was not the plan.

Got a call from my colleague [Heino Skov](https://twitter.com/heinoskov){:target="_blank"} last monday, that I was going.

So great opportunity, but tight schedule getting ready.

My company, [Businessmann](http://www.businessmann.dk){:target="_blank"}, have arranged a trip to VMworld 2014 in Barcelona, like last year<!--break-->.

This year it is organized in collaboration with [Arrow ECS Denmark](https://ecs-dk.arrow.com){:target="_blank"}. We arrived in Barcelona sunday around noon, and started by heading out for a beer at a local café, with customers and partners. Afterwards Arrow ECS, had arranged a lunch for all of us with great tapas, at [Piscolabis](http://www.piscolabisrestaurant.es){:target="_blank"}. And as such things go, we ended up having eaten too much :-)

Heino and I then went to the VMware Nordic Partner Briefing, which was held at the [Hotel 1898](http://www.hotel1898.com){:target="_blank"}, in downtown Barcelona, with a complementary dinner afterwards.

Monday started with a great customer/partner event, which was a Match Race sailing event in the Olympic Harbor of Barcelona, which was sponsored by [VMware](http://www.vmware.com){:target="_blank"}, [Nutanix](http://www.nutanix.com){:target="_blank"} and [PernixData](http://www.pernixdata.com){:target="_blank"}.

We were 8-9 boats in the water and had 3 regatta races.

After the Match Race, there was a combined tapas/bicycle tour, which Heino and I did not participate in, because we headed to the last part of Partner Day of VMworld.

We joined the others for a small beer event at our hotel, [Catalonia Ramblas](http://www.hoteles-catalonia.com/en/our_hotels/europa/spain/catalunya/barcelona/hotel_catalonia_ramblas/index.jsp){:target="_blank"}, sponsored by [F5 Networks](https://f5.com){:target="_blank"}. After that we headed out for dinner at [Restaurant Sagardi](http://www.sagardi.com){:target="_blank"}, for yet another round of tapas. When we where all filled up on tapas, we walk to the PernixData Party, which was held at [Ocaña](http://www.ocana.cat/en){:target="_blank"}. Great location and great people. I had a few good conversations, one of which was with CTO of PernixData, [Satyam Vaghani](https://twitter.com/SatyamVaghani){:target="_blank"}.

So now it is Tuesday, the first day of the "official" VMworld. I was at the General Session, where several key VMware people gave talks about the current state and future of VMware.

On stage was Maurizio Carli, Pat Gelsinger, Bill Fathers, Sanjay Poonen and Kit Colbert.

I hope everyone will have a great VMworld, and I hope to meet and talk with a lot of both new and old friends.
